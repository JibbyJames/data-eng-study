## ACID - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability

ACID is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These are a set of properties that ensure reliable processing of database transactions. Each of these properties plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and reliability of a database.

**Atomicity:** This property ensures that a transaction is all or nothing. A transaction is an indivisible unit of work. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database remains unchanged. This prevents partial updates that could lead to data corruption.

**Consistency:** Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another valid state, maintaining all predefined rules and constraints. After the transaction completes, all data must be in a valid state as defined by the database schema, rules, and constraints.

**Isolation:** Isolation ensures that the operations of a transaction are invisible to other transactions until the transaction is complete. This prevents transactions from interfering with each other and ensures that concurrent transactions execute as if they were run sequentially, maintaining the integrity of the database.

**Durability:** Durability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of a system failure. This means that the changes made by a transaction are permanently recorded in the database and will survive any subsequent failures.
