# 1.1 Designing for Security and Compliance

Google Cloud Platform offers a range of services and tools to address various aspects of cloud security, privacy, and compliance. Here's an overview of these concepts:

## Identity and Access Management

### Cloud IAM and Organization Policies

Cloud IAM Overview - https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview

- **Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM):** 
  - Manages access to GCP resources centrally.
  - Defines who (identity) has what access (role) to which resource.
  - IAM policies are hierarchical and can be applied at the organization, folder, project, and resource levels.
  - **Roles:** Predefined (basic, predefined roles) or custom. Roles are collections of permissions.
  - **Service Accounts:** Special accounts representing applications or virtual machines rather than individual end-users.

- **Organization Policies:** 
  - Provide centralized control over the organizationâ€™s cloud environment.
  - Set restrictions and guardrails, ensuring compliance with organizational standards and governance.
  
- **Resource Hierarchy**
  - Google Cloud resources are organized hierarchically
    - The organization is the root node in the hierarchy.
    - Folders are children of the organization, or of another folder.
    - Projects are children of the organization, or of a folder.
    - Resources for each service are descendants of projects.
  - Each resource has exactly one parent.

## Data Security

### Encryption and Key Management

Key management overview - https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/key-management-service

- **Encryption:** 
  - GCP provides both at-rest and in-transit encryption by default.
  - Data is encrypted at the storage layer and remains encrypted throughout its lifecycle.
  - **Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK):** Use your own encryption keys, managed through Cloud Key Management Service (KMS).
  - **Customer-Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEK):** Supply your own encryption keys for added control.

- **Key Management:** 
  - Cloud KMS enables centralized management of cryptographic keys.
  - Supports the creation, rotation, and destruction of keys, as well as defining permissions for key access.

## Privacy

### Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) API
- **PII:** 
  - GCP provides tools and best practices for handling PII.
  - Emphasizes data minimization, encryption, and access controls to protect sensitive information.

- **Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) API:** 
  - Part of Sensitive Data Protection product.
  - Video overview - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GArEb2e9jGk
  - Helps discover, classify, and protect sensitive information.
  - Analyzes structured and unstructured data.
  - Identifies sensitive data like PII, financial information, and more.
  - Can redact or mask sensitive information to prevent unauthorized access.

## Regional Considerations (Data Sovereignty)

### Data Access and Storage
- **Data Sovereignty:** 
  - Data is subject to the laws and regulations of the country in which it is located.
  - GCP provides various regions and zones to store data within specific geographic locations.
  - **Regional Services:** Allows choosing regions for services and data storage to meet data residency requirements.
  - **Multi-Region and Dual-Region:** Options for higher availability and compliance with redundancy and resilience requirements.

## Legal and Regulatory Compliance
