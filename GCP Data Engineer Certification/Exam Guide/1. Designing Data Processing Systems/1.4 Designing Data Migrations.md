# 1.4 Designing Data Migrations

### Considerations

#### Analysing Current Stakeholder Needs, Users, Processes, and Technologies
- **Stakeholder Analysis:** Identify key stakeholders and understand their data requirements and expectations.
- **User Requirements:** Gather detailed requirements from end-users regarding data access, performance, and functionality.
- **Process Mapping:** Document current data processes and workflows to understand how data is generated, processed, and consumed.
- **Technology Assessment:** Evaluate existing data technologies, storage solutions, and infrastructure to determine compatibility and migration needs.

#### Planning Migration to Google Cloud
- **BigQuery Data Transfer Service:** Automate data transfer from SaaS applications to BigQuery.
- **Database Migration Service:** Migrate databases with minimal downtime and risk.
- **Transfer Appliance:** Use physical devices to securely transfer large amounts of data.
- **Google Cloud Networking:** Ensure efficient and secure data transfer over the network using VPN or Interconnect.
- **Datastream:** Enable real-time change data capture and replication to keep data synchronized during migration.

#### Designing the Migration Validation Strategy
- **Data Integrity Checks:** Validate data integrity by comparing source and destination datasets.
- **Performance Testing:** Conduct performance testing to ensure the migrated data meets required SLAs.
- **Consistency Verification:** Ensure data consistency across source and destination systems.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Involve end-users in testing the migrated data and processes to ensure they meet business needs.

#### Designing the Project, Dataset, and Table Architecture
- **Project Structure:** Create a logical project structure to organize resources and manage access.
- **Dataset Organization:** Organize datasets based on business domains, access controls, and usage patterns.
- **Table Design:** Design tables to optimize for performance, storage, and query efficiency. Use partitioning and clustering where appropriate.
- **Data Governance:** Implement governance policies to ensure data quality, security, and compliance. Use IAM roles and policies to manage access.

### Example Scenarios and Architectures

#### Scenario 1: Migrating an On-Premises Data Warehouse to BigQuery
- **Business Requirement:** The company needs to migrate its on-premises data warehouse to BigQuery to improve scalability and reduce maintenance costs.
- **Solution:** Use BigQuery Data Transfer Service and Transfer Appliance for data migration.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Data Assessment:** Analyze the current data warehouse structure and data volumes.
  - **Data Transfer:** Use Transfer Appliance to move large datasets to Google Cloud Storage.
  - **Loading Data:** Use BigQuery Data Transfer Service to load data from Google Cloud Storage into BigQuery.
  - **Validation:** Perform data integrity checks and user acceptance testing to ensure successful migration.

#### Scenario 2: Real-Time Database Migration with Minimal Downtime
- **Business Requirement:** The company needs to migrate its production database to Google Cloud with minimal downtime.
- **Solution:** Use Database Migration Service and Datastream for continuous data replication and minimal downtime.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Initial Assessment:** Evaluate the current database setup and connectivity requirements.
  - **Data Migration:** Use Database Migration Service to set up the initial data migration.
  - **Continuous Replication:** Implement Datastream to capture and replicate changes in real-time during the migration process.
  - **Cutover:** Perform a cutover to the new database with minimal downtime after validating data consistency.

#### Scenario 3: Hybrid Cloud Data Migration Strategy
- **Business Requirement:** The company needs to move part of its data to Google Cloud while maintaining some data on-premises.
- **Solution:** Implement a hybrid cloud strategy using Google Cloud Interconnect and VPN for secure data transfer.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Hybrid Assessment:** Identify data that will remain on-premises and data that will move to Google Cloud.
  - **Secure Connectivity:** Set up Google Cloud Interconnect and VPN for secure and efficient data transfer.
  - **Data Synchronization:** Use Datastream for ongoing data synchronization between on-premises and cloud environments.
  - **Governance:** Ensure data governance policies are applied consistently across both environments.

#### Scenario 4: Comprehensive Data Governance During Migration
- **Business Requirement:** The company needs to ensure data governance and compliance during the migration process.
- **Solution:** Design a robust data governance framework using IAM, data cataloging, and encryption.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Governance Planning:** Define data governance policies and roles for the migration process.
  - **Access Control:** Use Cloud IAM to manage access to datasets and resources.
  - **Data Cataloging:** Implement Data Catalog to document and manage metadata for migrated datasets.
  - **Encryption:** Ensure all data is encrypted in transit and at rest using Cloud KMS.

By focusing on these considerations and scenarios, you will be better prepared to design and execute data migrations to Google Cloud, ensuring they are efficient, secure, and compliant with business requirements.
