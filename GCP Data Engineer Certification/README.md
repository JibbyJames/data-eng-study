# GCP Data Engineer

Resources related to the [GCP Professional Data Engineer](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/data-engineer) exam.

## My Plan

Focus on each sub-section listed in the Exam Guide one at a time, spending several hours on just that section, and document everything that is learned in its own file documented here. Use online resources, videos, ChatGPT, courses, to feel confident that everything in that section has been covered.
