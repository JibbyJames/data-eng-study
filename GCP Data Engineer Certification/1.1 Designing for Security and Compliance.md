# Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Security, Privacy, and Compliance

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers a range of services and tools to address various aspects of cloud security, privacy, and compliance. Here's an overview of these concepts:

## Identity and Access Management

### Cloud IAM and Organization Policies

Cloud IAM Overview - https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview

- **Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM):** 
  - Manages access to GCP resources centrally.
  - Defines who (identity) has what access (role) to which resource.
  - IAM policies are hierarchical and can be applied at the organization, folder, project, and resource levels.
  - **Roles:** Predefined (basic, predefined roles) or custom. Roles are collections of permissions.
  - **Service Accounts:** Special accounts representing applications or virtual machines rather than individual end-users.

- **Organization Policies:** 
  - Provide centralized control over the organizationâ€™s cloud environment.
  - Set restrictions and guardrails, ensuring compliance with organizational standards and governance.
  
- **Resource Hierarchy**
  - Google Cloud resources are organized hierarchically
    - The organization is the root node in the hierarchy.
    - Folders are children of the organization, or of another folder.
    - Projects are children of the organization, or of a folder.
    - Resources for each service are descendants of projects.
  - Each resource has exactly one parent.

## Data Security

### Encryption and Key Management

Encryption overview - https://cloud.google.com/docs/security/encryption/default-encryption<br>
Key management overview - https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/key-management-service

- **Encryption:** 
  - GCP provides both at-rest and in-transit encryption by default.
  - Data is encrypted at the storage layer and remains encrypted throughout its lifecycle.
  - **Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK):** Use your own encryption keys, managed through Cloud Key Management Service (KMS).
  - **Customer-Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEK):** Supply your own encryption keys for added control.

- **Key Management:** 
  - Cloud KMS enables centralized management of cryptographic keys.
  - Supports the creation, rotation, and destruction of keys, as well as defining permissions for key access.

## Privacy

### Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) API
- **PII:** 
  - GCP provides tools and best practices for handling PII.
  - Emphasizes data minimization, encryption, and access controls to protect sensitive information.

- **Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) API:** 
  - Part of Sensitive Data Protection product.
  - Video overview - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GArEb2e9jGk
  - Helps discover, classify, and protect sensitive information.
  - Analyzes structured and unstructured data.
  - Identifies sensitive data like PII, financial information, and more.
  - Can redact or mask sensitive information to prevent unauthorized access.

## Regional Considerations (Data Sovereignty)

### Data Access and Storage
- **Data Sovereignty:** 
  - Data is subject to the laws and regulations of the country in which it is located.
  - GCP provides various regions and zones to store data within specific geographic locations.
  - **Regional Services:** Allows choosing regions for services and data storage to meet data residency requirements.
  - **Multi-Region and Dual-Region:** Options for higher availability and compliance with redundancy and resilience requirements.

## Legal and Regulatory Compliance

### Compliance Frameworks and Certifications
#### **ISO/IEC 27001, 27017, 27018:** These standards focus on information security management and cloud privacy.

 - ISO/IEC 27001: GCP is certified for ISO/IEC 27001, which specifies requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS).
 - ISO/IEC 27017: GCP adheres to ISO/IEC 27017, which provides guidelines for information security controls applicable to the provision and use of cloud services.
 - ISO/IEC 27018: GCP complies with ISO/IEC 27018, which focuses on protecting personal data in the cloud.

Services: Google Cloud's entire infrastructure, including Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, and BigQuery, is built to comply with these standards.

#### **SOC 1, SOC 2, SOC 3:** These reports provide assurances about controls relevant to financial reporting and trust service criteria.

 - SOC 1: Addresses internal control over financial reporting.
 - SOC 2: Evaluates organizational controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.
 - SOC 3: Similar to SOC 2 but intended for a general audience, providing a summary of the findings.

Services: GCP services such as App Engine, BigQuery, and Google Kubernetes Engine are audited regularly to meet SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3 requirements.

#### **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):** GDPR aims to protect the personal data of all EU residents.

 - Services and Tools:
   - Data Processing Addendum (DPA): GCP offers a GDPR-compliant DPA to ensure customers can use GCP services in compliance with GDPR.
   - Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) API: Helps discover, classify, and protect sensitive data.
   - Access Transparency: Provides visibility into GCP administrator access to customer data.
   - Encryption: Default encryption for data at rest and in transit.
   - Regional: Most services can be enabled in the EU.

#### **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act):** Supports HIPAA compliance through covered services for healthcare customers.

 - Services:
   - Healthcare API: Allows processing and analyzing healthcare data in a compliant manner.
   - Cloud Healthcare API: Manages healthcare data and supports interoperability.
   - Covered Services: GCP services like Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, and BigQuery can be used in HIPAA-compliant environments when configured correctly and under a Business Associate Agreement (BAA).

#### **FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program):** FedRAMP provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services.

 - Services:
   - Authorized Products: GCP services such as Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, and BigQuery have FedRAMP authorizations at various levels (Moderate and High).
   - Compliance Documentation: GCP provides detailed documentation and support for customers needing to meet FedRAMP requirements.

#### **COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act):** COPPA aims to protect the privacy of children under 13.

 - Services and Tools:
   - Compliance: GCP provides tools to help customers build COPPA-compliant applications, ensuring the collection and use of children's data is managed appropriately.
   - Parental Consent Management: Tools to help developers obtain and manage parental consent.

### Compliance Tools
  - GCP offers tools like the Compliance Resource Center, Cloud Security Command Center, and Access Transparency.
  - Provides insights, audit capabilities, and policy enforcement to help ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

By leveraging these GCP services and features, organizations can effectively manage identity and access, secure data, ensure privacy, address regional data sovereignty concerns, and comply with relevant legal and regulatory frameworks.
