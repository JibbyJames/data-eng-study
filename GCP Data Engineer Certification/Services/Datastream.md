Datastream is a serverless and easy-to-use change data capture (CDC) and replication service that lets you synchronize data reliably, and with minimal latency. Datastream provides seamless replication of data from operational databases into BigQuery. In addition, Datastream supports writing the change event stream into Cloud Storage, and offers streamlined integration with Dataflow templates to build custom workflows for loading data into a wide range of destinations, such as Cloud SQL and Spanner.
