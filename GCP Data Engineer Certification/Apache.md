### Ecosystem of Big Data Tools  
Over time, Apache has built an interconnected ecosystem of complementary big data software. Many of these tools are foundational to modern data workflows and are also integrated into Google Cloud services. For example:

- **Hadoop**: For distributed storage and batch processing.  
  - **GCP Service**: Cloud Dataproc enables running Hadoop workloads with minimal infrastructure management.  

- **Spark**: For fast, in-memory data processing.  
  - **GCP Service**: Cloud Dataproc supports Spark clusters for processing big data efficiently.  

- **Kafka**: For real-time data streaming.  
  - **GCP Service**: Pub/Sub and Dataflow integrate with Kafka-like workflows for stream processing and messaging.  

- **Hive**: For querying large datasets using SQL-like syntax.  
  - **GCP Service**: Cloud Dataproc supports Hive for batch querying on large datasets.  

- **Flink**: For stream and batch data processing.  
  - **GCP Service**: Dataflow provides a fully managed Flink-based solution for streaming and batch pipelines.  

- **Airflow**: For orchestrating workflows.  
  - **GCP Service**: Cloud Composer is a managed version of Apache Airflow for automating workflows and data pipelines.
